This repository contains Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects developed in Python. Each project demonstrates the use of classes, encapsulation, and abstraction.

# Object-Oriented Programming Activities in Python

## 1. Fan Class

The Fan class Design a class named Fan to represent a fan. The class contains:

■ Three constants named `SLOW`, `MEDIUM`, and `FAST` with the values `1`, `2`, and `3` to denote the fan speed.

■ A private int data field named `speed` that specifies the speed of the fan.

■ A private bool data field named `on` that specifies whether the fan is on (the default is `False`).

■ A private float data field named `radius` that specifies the radius of the fan.

■ A private string data field named `color` that specifies the color of the fan.

■ The accessor (`getters`) and mutator (`setters`) methods for all four data fields.

■ A constructor that creates a fan with the specified speed (default `SLOW`), radius (`5`), color (`blue`), and on (`False`).

Write a test program named `TestFan` that creates two `Fan` objects.
For the first object, assign the maximum speed, radius `10`, color `yellow`, and turn it on.
Assign medium speed, radius `5`, color `blue`, and turn it off for the second object.
Display each object’s `speed`, `radius`, `color`, and `on` properties.

## 2. Car Class

Write a class named `Car` that has the following data attributes:

• `__year_model` (for the car’s year model)

• `__make` (for the make of the car)

• `__speed` (for the car’s current speed)

• The `Car` class should have an `__init__` method that accepts the car’s year model and make as arguments.
These values should be assigned to the object’s `__year_model` and `__make` data attributes.
It should also assign `0` to the `__speed` data attribute.

The class should also have the following methods:

• `accelerate()`
The accelerate method should add `5` to the speed data attribute each time it is called.

• `brake()`
The brake method should subtract `5` from the speed data attribute each time it is called.

• `get_speed()`
The get_speed method should return the current speed.

Next, design a program that creates a `Car` object then calls the `accelerate()` method five times.
After each call to the `accelerate()` method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
Then call the `brake()` method five times.
After each call to the `brake()` method, get the current speed of the car and display it.

## 3. Pet Class

Write a class named `Pet`, which should have the following data attributes:

• `__name` (for the name of a pet)

• `__animal_type` (for the type of animal that a pet is. Example values are ‘Dog’, ‘Cat’, and ‘Bird’)

• `__age` (for the pet’s age)

The `Pet` class should have an `__init__` method that creates these attributes.

It should also have the following methods:

• `set_name()` This method assigns a value to the `__name` field.

• `set_animal_type()` This method assigns a value to the `__animal_type` field.

• `set_age()` This method assigns a value to the `__age` field.

• `get_name()` This method returns the value of the `__name` field.

• `get_animal_type()` This method returns the value of the `__animal_type` field.

• `get_age()` This method returns the value of the `__age` field.


Once you have written the class, write a program that creates an object of the class and prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of his or her pet. This data should be stored as the object’s attributes. Use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve the pet’s name, type, and age and display this data on the screen.
